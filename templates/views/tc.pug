  br
  p Welcome to Solvers Club. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us. These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Solvers Club Plataforma de Respuestas SL. (“Solvers Club,” “we” and “us”). Solvers Club is organized under the laws of the laws of Spain, and has offices located at Santa Teresa 7, Madrid 28004, Spain. You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.
  br
  p We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.SolversClub.com website, by sending you an email, or by some other means. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 14 days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
  br
  p Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
  br
  p You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and username (“Solvers Club User ID”). You must provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your Solvers Club User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You also may not have, control, or operate under more than one active Solvers Club account or Solvers Club User ID. If we determine that you have, control, or are operating under more than one Solvers Club account or Solvers Club User ID, we may take action without notice, including banning your user account, revoking access to your Solvers Club User ID, and withdrawing any Solvers Club resources which may have been assigned to you.
  br
  p Solvers Club Membership is limited to individuals. You may not use our Services on behalf of an organization or entity. You are not allowed to allow multiple individuals to operate under one Solvers Club User ID.

  p You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We are not responsible if you use the Services in a way that breaks the law.
  br
  p You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.

You acknowledge and agree that Solvers Club, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of communication networks, devices, services, or media, and the licenses you grant under these Terms include the rights to do so. You also agree that all of the licenses you grant under these Terms are royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and worldwide. These are licenses only — your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
