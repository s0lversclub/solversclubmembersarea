  h1.title="Privacy Policy"
  br
  p This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us on info@solversclub.com.
  br
  p We collect information to provide better Services to all our users.
  br
  p When you clicked “accept” or “agree” in connection with registering your account, we made available to you this Privacy Policy and the information handling practices described in here. This Privacy Policy only covers Solvers Club's practices regarding personal information, and not information more generally. We may use aggregated, anonymized data that we derived from your personal information before you deleted it, but not in a manner that incorporates any of your personal information or would identify you personally.
  br
  p We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with Solvers Club, in which case Solvers Club may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Services.
  br
  p Information Solvers Club Collects
  br
  p When you’re not signed into a Solvers Club account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. When you’re signed in, we collect information that we store with your Solvers Club account.
  br
  p When you create a Solvers Club account, and use the Services, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You may also provide your mailing address and home/mobile phone number, or other personal information.
  br
  p Your provision of this personal data is required for you to enter into the Terms of Use. If you do not provide the minimum amount of personal data required to register an account, including your name and email address, you cannot use the Services, as this information is necessary for contractual reasons. Certain parts of the Services also require you to provide a mobile phone number, which is needed to protect against fraud and abuse. Please see “European Requirements” below for further information on the bases for our processing your personal information.
  br
  p We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our Services. This includes things like messages you write and receive, forum posts, notebooks, datasets, and competition submissions.
  br
  p We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access our Services or open one of our HTML emails by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (also known as “IP address”) or other device address or ID, web browser or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Services, the pages you view on the Services, and the dates and times that you visit the Services.
  br
  p We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.
  br
  p We collect information about your activity in our Services, which may include:
  br
  p Views and interactions with content and ads.
  br
  p People with whom you communicate or share content.
  br
  p When you use the Services, we send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. For example, we use cookies to ensure proper navigation between pages on the Services. Solvers Club may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services.
  br
  p Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser’s “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. If you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.
  br
  p We may also implement on the Services third party content, such as advertising or analytic services, that uses “clear gifs,” “web beacons,” or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser or implement similar tracking mechanisms. This information is collected directly by the third party, and Solvers Club does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. We currently implement services provided by Google Analytics and Facebook.
  br
  p When you link an account you may have on a third party service (such as a third party social networking site or email provider) to your Solvers Club account, Solvers Club collects certain information stored in connection with that account that you have configured that service to make available, including your email address, provider ID, first and last name, and profile picture. By linking your accounts in this manner, you authorize Solvers Club to access and use your account on the third party service in connection with your use of the Services.
  br
  p Managing and Deleting Your Information
  br
  p When you’re signed into your Solvers Club account, you can always review and update information by visiting your account profile.
  br
  p You can export a copy of content in your Solvers Club account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Solvers Club by contacting us. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page or editing your Solvers Club account profile through the Services.
  br
  p You can also delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and notebooks by using the available tools in our Services. If desired, you can delete your entire Solvers Club account by choosing that option in your account settings page.
  br
  p Please note that while your deletions are reflected promptly in active member databases, in some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes. See “Data Retention” below for more information.
  br
  p There are other ways to control the information Solvers Club collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Solvers Club account, including configuring your browser to indicate when Solvers Club has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our Services rely on cookies to function properly.
  br
  p Data Retention
  br
  p As we describe above, you can delete your entire Solvers Club account or selectively delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and notebooks by using the available tools in our Services. In some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time. For each type of data, we set retention timeframes based on the reason for its collection.
  br
  p Sometimes business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for specific purposes for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:
  br
  p Security, fraud & abuse prevention
  br
  p Financial record-keeping
  br
  p Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
  br
  p Ensuring the continuity of our services
  br
  p When you delete data in your Solvers Club account, we immediately start the process of removing it from the product and our systems. First, we aim to immediately remove it from view. For example, if you delete a post you made, we will immediately remove that from the public-facing Solvers Club website.
  br
  p We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. Safe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss. Complete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users’ peace of mind. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion. This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was removed unintentionally.
  br
  p Each of our storage systems from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion. This might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or brief delays to allow for recovery from mistakes. As a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data.
  br
  p Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on these systems for up to 6 months.
  br
  p As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes defined in this article. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.
  br
  p Sharing Your Information
  br
  p Many of our Services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in an area of the Services accessible to other Solvers Club members or the public, such as a public profile page or in a forum posting, will be available to other Solvers Club members who access that content or the public (as applicable). This also applies to information you choose to make available through features that connect to third party services, if applicable.
  br
  p Also, if you communicate directly with another Solvers Club member, any information that you voluntarily choose to include in such a communication with other Solvers Club members will be available to such other members. Once you make your information available in any of these ways, it could be collected and used by the recipients without restriction. We urge Solvers Club members to exercise common sense, prudence and good judgment about what information to make available to others through the Services.
  br
  p We do not sell your information. We do, however, disclose your personal information in connection with developing and maintaining the Services. We share your personal information in the following cases:
  br
  p We’ll share personal information outside of Solvers Club when we have your consent. For example, if you give us permission to share your information with a third party who may be a prospective employer.
  br
  p Solvers Club may disclose your personal information to the hosts of competitions to enable your participation in the competitions and our operation of the competitions. The terms of that disclosure are covered in the competition rules, which is a contract between you and the competition sponsor.
  br
  p We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support. These third parties may have access to or process your personal information as a result of performing the services they were engaged to perform.
  br
  p We will share personal information outside of Solvers Club if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
  br
  p Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
  br
  p Enforce our Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations, and take precautions against liability.
  br
  p Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues.
  br
  p Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Solvers Club or our affiliates, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
  br
  p Protect the security or integrity of the Services and to protect or enforce third party rights.
  br
  p We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our Services.
  br
  p If Solvers Club is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  br
  p Our Commitment to Data Security
  br
  p Solvers Club uses a variety of physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to improve the security of our systems and your personal information.
  br
  p If Solvers Club learns of a security breach, we will notify you in accordance with applicable law.
  br
  p Third Party Websites
  br
  p The Services contain links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any personal information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s policies governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Services. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personal information.
  br
  p Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy
  br
  p Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, Solvers Club does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years old, and no part of the Services is directed to persons under 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.
  br
  p If Solvers Club learns that personal information of children under 13 years old has been collected on the Services without verifiable parental consent, then Solvers Club will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a user account on the Services, then you may alert Solvers Club and request that Solvers Club delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
  br
  p If you are between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, you may not use the Services until Solvers Club has received verifiable parental consent for your use of the Services. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17 years old or under the age of contractual majority in your country, you also may not enter any competitions until Solvers Club has received verifiable parental consent for your entry into a specific competition. Please check the eligibility rules for each competition to verify that minors are allowed to participate and ensure that the parental consent form is on file for each competition.
  br
  p Data Transfers
  br
  p Your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the European frameworks described below.
  br
  p When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
  br
  p European Requirements
  br
  p If European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
  br
  p We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
  br
  p We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can manage these settings in your Solvers Club account.
  br
  p We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:
  br
  p Providing, maintaining, and improving our Services to meet the needs of our users
  br
  p Developing new products and features that are useful for our users
  br
  p Understanding how people use our Services to ensure and improve the performance of our Services
  br
  p Customizing our Services to provide you with a better user experience
  br
  p Marketing to inform users about our Services
  br
  p Providing advertising to make many of our Services freely available for users
  br
  p Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our Services
  br
  p Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Solvers Club, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law
  br
  p Performing research that improves our Services for our users and benefits the public
  br
  p Fulfilling obligations to our partners like developers and rights holders
  br
  p Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of our Terms of Use
  br
  p We process your data to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract. For example, we process your information in connection with competitions you enter.
  br
  p When we’re complying with legal obligations
  br
  p We’ll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.
  br
  p Contact information
  br
  p If you have questions, you can contact Solvers Club. You can also contact your data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under Brazilian law.
  br
  p Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy
  br
  p We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the last changes were published and if changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).
  br
  p Our amended Privacy Policy will become effective on a going-forward basis as stated in the Terms, except that (i) unless you agree otherwise, we will use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you must terminate your Solvers Club membership and cease use of the Services. Your continued use of the Services after a revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.
