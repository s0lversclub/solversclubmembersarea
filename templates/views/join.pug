  .block First, we'd like to make sure we are a good fit.
  .block Solvers Club is a community of people united by their passion to compete to solve complex challenges using their skills and ingenuity. We form teams to work intensely and share resources amongst us.
  .block Therefore, a considerable level of trust is required between our members.
  .block It takes a significant commitment to participate in these competitions. So, before applying, we’d like to draw your attention to the following, in order to avoid wasting everybody’s time.
  .block Please, do not apply if:
  .block You do not enjoy sharing your passion with others, whether as part of a team or a community.
  .block You don’t see the point in competing with others, and would rather just cruise along at your own speed.
  .block You like taking shortcuts and are prepared to do whatever it takes to win.
  .block If you are still interested, then we would like to hear more from you.
